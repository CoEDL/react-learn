# What's all this then?

Somewhere to collect resources and toy repos that demonstrate concepts and techniques for React.

[Start with the Wiki.](https://github.com/CoEDL/react-learn/wiki)

## react-props

This is the result of the first workshops from the wiki, demonstrating how to write a custom component and passing props around.

## react-axios

How to read data from an API, and show some results on a page.

## redux-toy

This demonstrates how to put the bits together to use Redux with React. Redux is a way of handling "state" centrally.

## redux-persistent

This app shows how to persist the Redux store. Eg, do something with a web app, store the data in the browser so a process can be resumed when the app is revisited.

## redux-thunk

This app shows how to write asynchronous logic for Redux actions. Redux by itself can only do simple, synchronous actions. Use Redux Thunk to deal with things like getting data from APIs etc, where you are waiting for a response.
